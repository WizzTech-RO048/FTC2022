# Autonomy

As you probably know, the FIRST Tech Challenge usual challenge is developing a robot that will have an autonomy period, of 30 seconds, and then a controlled period of 2 miuntes.

During the autonomy period, no one should interfere with the actions of the robot on the playing field. 

So, the robot should be able to know where it is by the environment. Thoretically, the robot should have only one autonomy loaded, but practically, during the 2021-2022 Freight Frenzy season, we have developed 4 different autonomies for the robot. It depends on the position that robot is starting the match : RED 1, RED 2, BLUE 1 or BLUE 2.
