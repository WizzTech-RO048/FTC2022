# States

For the autonomy code, we implemented a _state machine_ . Basically, this helps us understand better what actions are invoked during the autonmy period.

The [State.java](https://github.com/WizzTech-RO048/FTC2022/blob/post-spring-demo-branch/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/States/State.java) file is the class for our basic state structure file.
